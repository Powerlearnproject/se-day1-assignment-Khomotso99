Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the establish
mentand and use of sound enginerring princeples,methods,tools that can be used to produce high quality software that is reliable and works efficiently on real machines.
The importance of Software enginerring in the technology industry:It helps create software that meets user needs and drives innovation.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
  1.The development of high-level programming language:Language like Fortran,COBOL,C allow for more human-readable code, making software development more accessible.
  2.The emergence of artificial inteligence (AI):AI technologies are now being integrated into various software applications, enabling advanced features like machine learning and natural language.
  3.The adoption of cloud computing:Cloud platforms provide scalable infrastructure and on-demand access to computing resources, revolutionizing software development and management.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.Planing: Define the project scope,goals,and resource allocation.
2.Requirement Gathering:Identifying and documenting all functional and non-functional needs of the software from stakeholder.
3.Design: Creating a detailed system architecture, including user interface design, data model,and system components.
4.Implementation (Coding):Transalating the design into actual code using the chosen programming language.
5.Testing:Executing test case to identify and fix bug,ensuring the software functions as intended and meets requirements.
5.Deployment:Distributing the completed software to the production environment for user access.
6.Maintenance:Ongoing updates,bug fixes, and enhancements to the software after deployment to address user feedback and changing needs.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
 Waterfall is a linear,sequential approach to project management where each phase must be completed before moving to the next E.g like puzzle.
 Agile methodology is an iterative approach that allow for flexibility and continuous feedback throughout the development process,making it better suited for projects with changing requirements or uncertain conditions E.g is like building Lego house ,one piece at the time.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Development: creating softwarearchitecture, writing code,performing quality checks, and ensuring the final product functions as intended often collaborating with other team members like designers and project managers to designers.
Quality Assurance Engineer: Examine programs to identify bugs and defects, especially when they appear unexpectedly.
Project Management:Organise software projects and canassign tasks to software engineering teams according to the specifications of tasks.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) is a software application that helps programmers develop software code efficiently for example Microsoft Visual Studio,Adobe Flex Builder,Netbeans
Version Control System (VCS) It allows developers to track changes made to code over time, enabling them to easily revert to previous if needed,collaborate effictively with other developers,and maintain code integrity,essentially acting as a safety net for the development process.E.g Git,Subversion and Mercurial.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
By embracing cotinuous learning to keep up with evolving technology,fostering clear communication with stakeholders, utilizing agile methodologies like DevOps, implementing robust testing and automation practices.Prioritizing code quality through reviews and standards,investing in security testing tools,and adopting a proactive approach to system intergration and monitoring to identify potential issues early on.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing:Test individual components or unit code to verify their functionality,considered the first level of testing and crucial for identifying early bugs withinmodule.
Intergration Testing: Examine how different module or units interact when combined,identifying issues related to data flow and communication between components.
System Testing:Test the entire software system as a whole to ensure all features and functionalities work together as expect,often performed near the end of development.
Acceptence Testing: Conducted by end users to verify if the software meets their requirementsand is ready for development,including business acceptance testing and user acceptence testing.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt.It helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human bias in the large language models training data.Further,it enhances the user AI interaction so the AI understands the user's intention even with minimal input.It also improve efficiency accuracy,and personalization.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.   
  Vogue prompt:
  "Today's technology is afffecting peoples learning"
  Technology provides dynamic and interactive tools that engage student in ways traditional methods cannot.
  SPECIFIC
  Technology meet human need and solve problem.
